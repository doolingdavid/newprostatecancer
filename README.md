======

This repository contains the source code for a machine learning 
algorithm using scikit-learn and the SEER cancer data. 
The app asks for input from a user and outputs the predicted survival curve based on the input data.

The model in the MALEGENCLASSIFIER folder is a sklearn
 RandomForestClassifier object that implements the transformation of censored
 data to a form appropriate for machine learning algorithms as described here:
